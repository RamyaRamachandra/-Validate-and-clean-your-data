    "class=\"anchor-link\">¶</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you'll want to simplify a numeric column by converting it to\n",
    "a categorical column. To do this, one common approach is to break the\n",
    "range of possible values into a defined number of equally sized bins and\n",
    "assign each bin a name. In the next step, you'll practice this process.\n",

    "class=\"anchor-link\">¶</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Three common methods for changing categorical data to numerical are:\n",

    "1.  Label encoding: order matters (ordinal numeric labels)\n",
    "2.  Label encoding: order doesn't matter (nominal numeric labels)\n",
    "3.  Dummy encoding: order doesn't matter (creation of binary columns for\n",

    "\n",
    "The decision on which method to use depends on the context and must be\n",
    "made on a case-to-case basis. However, a distinction is typically made\n",
    "between categorical variables with equal weight given to all possible\n",
    "categories vs. variables with a hierarchical structure of importance to\n",
    "their possible categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a variable called `subject` might have possible values of\n",
    "`history`, `mathematics`, `literature`. In this case, each subject might\n",
    "be **nominal**—given the same level of importance. However, you might\n",
    "have another variable called `class`, whose possible values are\n",
    "`freshman`, `sophomore`, `junior`, `senior`. In this case, the class\n",
    "variable is **ordinal**—its values have an ordered, hierarchical\n",
    "structure of importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models typically need all data to be numeric, and they\n",
    "generally use ordinal label encoding (method 1) and dummy encoding\n",
    "(method 3).\n",
